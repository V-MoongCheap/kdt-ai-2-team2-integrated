# Data Artifact Status

| Artifact | Status | Intended use |
|---|---|---|
| `data/interim/products/product_staging.parquet` | Usable | AI-Hub normalized staging |
| `data/processed/product_catalog/product_catalog_v1.parquet` | Usable with caveats | Observed AI-Hub catalog and provenance |
| `data/processed/category/category_master_v1.csv` | Usable with caveats | KAN-level observed category candidates for the full AI-Hub catalog |
| `data/processed/category/aihub_category_hierarchy_v0.csv` | Usable with caveats | AI-Hub source-path hierarchy; draft category candidates |
| `data/processed/facet_discovery/aihub_exploratory_facet_taxonomy_v0.json` | Exploratory only | AI-Hub logistics analysis; not health taxonomy |
| `data/synthetic/demands/synthetic_demands_v0.csv` | Test-only | Clearly marked synthetic Demand input bound to observed catalog IDs |
| `data/processed/demands/demand_labeled_v0.csv` | Test-only | Synthetic mechanics output; not a user Demand or health result |
| `data/processed/category/health_category_seed_v0.csv` | Pending | MFDS-only health taxonomy seed; not needed for the AI-Hub full catalog hierarchy |
| `data/interim/facet_discovery/i0030_products_clean.csv` | Partial | 19,700 MFDS I0030 rows; facts/distributions only, not an approved taxonomy |
| `data/reports/mfds_status.json` | Failed/Pending | Must reflect the latest MFDS collection attempt |

Generated data and raw files are ignored by Git. Only code, tests, and documentation should be committed to the repository.

The AI-Hub source has 6,382 barcode-format-invalid observations. They remain in staging for auditability, but are excluded from barcode identity grouping.
